 Not the most glamorous name..

 This is rewritten from a java/swing game I made for a class project, mostly
 as a bit of practice in learning the C language (and SDL!)

 It now has a random maze generator (!) and keyboard controls to set it apart
 from the original, but I haven't added any kind of dialog boxes to explain
 the "story" or congratulate you on your success.

 Dependancies:
    
    make, gcc, SDL2, SDL2_image

 Installation/Build:
    
    on Unix-likes, cd to the directory with the files and run make
    
    if building on Windows.. ?  I don't really know Windows development

 Objective:
    
    find the treasure


 Controls:
    
    WASD for turning and movement

    ESC to quit (or just close the window)

 
 Things I'd like to add:

    cleaner code
        This is the first thing I've written in C, and I had no idea how
        to organize things.

    animations

    items/powerups
        Flashlight batteries might be a good place to start

    multiple levels

    story?

    monsters?
        really this could become a rogue-like pretty easily
