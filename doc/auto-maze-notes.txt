For making a basic type maze, without rooms:

    have a starting point, with a direction

    choices for the next recursive call are forward, left, right, or branch (two or all three of the previous)
    
        if one of these choices intersects with a previous branch, it isnt taken

        branches cannot be written in a depth-first fasion, though, or the map would fill up with one long one

            to this end, maybe I could make a linked list of branch heads -- a new branch is added when created, and for 
            each iteration the list is traversed and each branch has a certain probability of being advanced
            (here, advanced simply means picking one of those recursive call options)
            each new tile that the branch fills becomes the new head of that branch stored in the list.

            the algorithm ends and writes a file when no branches can advance any further

        constants for straightness/bendyness (weighing forward moves over turns) and branchyness could be tweaked to get the best mazes


if I wanted to add rooms, I could plop randomly sized rectangles on top of the completed maze before it is written to file.

    this could also become a difficulty changer -- easier levels have more/larger rooms



then, the player could be placed at the start-point or at a random point in the maze, and the goal could be placed at a branch head
or at a random point (though a branch head might be necessary for the goal, so that it does not cut off large portions of the maze)



moving beyond, it would be useful for the algorithm to be able to take a partial maze as an argument (such as a "final floor" with a 
specifically designed treasure room) and for it to be able to fill in specified sections of the maze with random corridors

    a special character could be used as a "coupling point" -- its a space that isnt considered as such by the algorithm and therefore
    can be intersected by randomly generated halls (of course, I'd have to find some way to guaruntee that it *is* intersected)


while we're taking random ideas, how about a converter on the side for turning bitmaps into text-mazes? that way I could draw new levels
with my magical computer pen instead of vim...
