pokemon-like movement and 3d-looking walls

change object to general treasure collecting? piles of coins and chests that need keys?
  of course, flashing messages when you get it

multiple levels? tooltip messages to tell you controls for going up/down stairs etc?

flashlight batteries

pits that cannot be crossed but can be seen across

monsters that only move in the dark

breadcrumb pickups that give you limited mapping

guns to kill the monsters?

tutorial level in full-visibility hedge-maze?


incomplete maps!!!

    for the tomb setting, there could be a drawn-map type overlay in areas you can't see, and it could be different in some places from the actual map ( cave-ins and pits and such might show up )

    for a space-station setting, it could be more of a hologram thing
